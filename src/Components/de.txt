`int RelationManagementImpl::CM_ALS_check_read_denied` is the function signature or function prototype of the method being implemented. 

The function signature specifies the function name (`CM_ALS_check_read_denied`), its return type (`int`), and its parameter list (in this case, `const char* propertyName`, `const char* typeName`, and `bool has_read_access`). 

The `RelationManagementImpl` part of the signature suggests that the method is a member of a class named `RelationManagementImpl`, which is defined elsewhere in the code. The `::` operator is used to specify that the method is a member of the `RelationManagementImpl` class.
