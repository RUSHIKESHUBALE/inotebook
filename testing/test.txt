Your love in my heart is fresh and preserved each day for the next day to come. Since I met you, I’ve had no regrets, and I’m positive there won’t be one, ever. With you in my life, my days are much better. To the woman of my dreams, the one that calms my spirit always, the only woman that holds my heart locked, I love you too much, babe. I don’t care what anyone says or whatever happens, you will always be my one and only woman.”

I love the perfect blend that makes you up as a woman, my woman. Just like the first time we met, you still successfully make my heart race and send signals to my brain. I love that I am spending the rest of my life with you, that’s the fulfillment of an age-long dream I’ve had since we met. You have created beautiful times and experiences for us, and I am just glad that my life is with yours every day. I love you so much, darling, you’re my baby girl no matter how old we grow together.”

My home is blessed to have you in it. With each new day, I love you more than the previous days. You compliment me and bring out the best that I’ve got to offer. Having you close to me is the best feeling ever. It will cost me nothing to promise you that I will love you forever and ever because you’re deserving of that and more. With you in my arms and in my heart, there’s nothing in the world that I cannot face. And I will do just anything for you. That’s the extent of my love for you, every day.”
